```ts
type ExecutionStrategyType = 'auto' | 'local' | 'worker' | 'remote';
```

The strategy used to determine which compute backend to use.

- `auto`: Automatically select the best backend available.
- `local`: Run tasks directly on the main thread.
- `worker`: Offload tasks to WebWorker or thread-based compute.
- `remote`: Offload tasks to a remote server or service.

## Example

const strategy: ExecutionStrategyType = 'worker';
```
